## Python image viewer

This was developed during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis, as part of the Polyglottal week project, where we create an application using a language we have never used before.

This is a simple image viewer application, using the Python Tkinter and Pillow libraries.
It includes three ways to render images in a GUI:

<ul>
    <li> Single image: `single_image.py`<li>
    <li> List of images rendered by clicking a button: `image_list3.py`<li>
    <li> List of images in a slideshow: `slideshow1.py`<li>
<ul>

There are 2 folders containing the photos used: `img` for the original photos, and `resized-img` where the resized photos are saved using the function in `resize_img.py`.
