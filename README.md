## Python image viewer

This was developed during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis, as part of the Polyglottal week project, where we create an application using a language we have never used before.

This is a simple image viewer application, using the Python Tkinter and Pillow libraries.
It includes three ways to render images in a GUI:

* Single image: `single_image.py`
* List of images rendered by clicking a button: `image_list3.py`
* List of images in a slideshow: `slideshow1.py`

There are 2 folders containing the photos used: `img` for the original photos, and `resized-img` where the resized photos are saved using the function in `resize_img.py`.

The implementation was inspired by the Codemy.com [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg4c92pNFeo&t=981s&ab_channel=Codemy.com) (code included in `image_list1_tutorial`).
